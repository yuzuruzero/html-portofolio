<h1>The Best Movie According to Kresentia in 2024</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movie Netflix</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Damsel</h3>
<p>The story about medieval time like kingdoms and dragons, where the main character is a princess from a poor country.
For her country she marry to a wealth prince, in order to gain supplies for her people so they can whitstand winter without starving.
But it's not a happy end for her, because after they are getting married, he sacrifice her to a dragon's lair.<br/>
The story about the survival of the princess facing the dragon's wrath. It's really good for people who likes story about tough woman fighting for herself</p>

<h3>Parasyte : The Grey</h3>
<p>The story about unidentified creatures that looks like a parasyte starting to drop from out of nowhere and inject themselves to human as their host and gain the control of their brain.
The main character is a girl that suffered from bad luck throughout her life, at the end of her life, she's dying after getting stabbed by crazy man when going home from work.
Don't know it's bad luck or good luck, the parasyte drop near her, because there's no other human nearby, it inject itself to the girl and save her life.<br/>
The story really good, especially if you've already watched Parasyte movie before this series, it's a lot of cutting human so probably not recommended for kid to watch.

<h3>Avatar : The Last Airbender</h3>
<p>
The story about a kid named Aang who was an Avatar which can control 4 elements, but he still not mastered all the other elements except air. When he got an order from his teacher to learn the other elements, suddenly a fire nation which wield fire elements come and attack Aang's home in other to kill the Avatar, but fortunately Aang have already gone when they come and got trapped in the storm instead, to save his life from the storm Aang froze a big air ball surrounded himself and remains unconcious for 100 years.<br/>
The story is really interesting because it's about an adventure of a 112 year old kid and his friends going around the world to learn the other elements that he yet to learn while avoiding the fire nations that trying to capture him.
